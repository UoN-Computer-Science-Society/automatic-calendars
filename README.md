# Automatic Calendars
UNM timetabling is a webpage provided by the University of Nottingham to provide all students with their timestables. It is a webpage, while many students plan their daily tasks on calendar applications such as OutlookCalendar or GoogleCalendar. Manually transcribing each class session creates the risk of manual error. AutomaticCalendar is an application that will automatically create an OutlookCalendar/GoogleCalendar out of your timetabling link.

### Features
Features include:
- Create a website to be hosted on the CSS VPS
- Create an application that only accepts timetabling links
- Create an outlook calendar using web scraping
- Automatically add created calendar to users account
